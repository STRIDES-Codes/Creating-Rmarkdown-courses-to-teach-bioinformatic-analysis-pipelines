Rmarkdown - Seurat application incorporating with LearnR (From “Standard pre-processing workflow” to “Determine the 'dimensionality' of the dataset”)


What's the problem?

It can be difficult for bioinformaticians to learn data processing and analyzing for different methodologies. There are often many different tools, and it is not always obvious which is the most efficient/effective/tailored to that model/accurate. Despite bioinformatics being increasingly essential to biological sciences, programming is often not adequately taught in undergraduate and graduate biology classes. people pick it up piecemeal 


Bioinformatic data analysis pipelines can be difficult for beginners to learn
Many different tools do the same task. Which is best?
Programming is often not taught in undergraduate biology, despite R being a popular tool for bioinformatics
We set out to create an interactive, computationally light way to teach bioinformatics to beginners

How should we solve it?
Using the existing infrastructure of LearnR, we set out to create courses to teach standard reproducible bioinformatic pipelines. 
flexibility for interactivity
determine amount of background knowledge they have/need
we can provide additional resources, break it down into small steps with feedback
proof of concept by teaching scRNA sequencing analysis using seurat

existing infrastructure of teaching R in R, repuposing teaching tools in R for bioinformatics

What is Seurat?
